# Performance Analysis of HBM Memory on Reconfigurable Devices

## Overview

This repository contains the research work conducted for the MSc thesis titled "Performance Analysis of HBM Memory on Reconfigurable Devices Using Different Design Flows." The objective of this thesis was to compare the performance of two prominent design flows, Vivado and Vitis Accel, when developing an application that utilizes the High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) featured on the Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA.

For more information about the two parts of the work, please refer to the README files included in the two subfolders.

## Research Focus

The primary focus of this research was to evaluate the performance and efficiency of HBM memory utilization in the context of FPGA-based reconfigurable devices. The study aimed to assess the two primary design flows provided by Xilinx, namely Vivado and Vitis Accel.

In particular, The objectives of this work were:

- To compare the different possible approaches to develop applications that use the HBM memory in an FPGA system. The comparison will be based on the HBM performance, resource utilization, power consumption and ease of development.
- To develop a simple application capable of reading/writing from/to the HBM memory using both Development Flows.
- To try to get close to the theoretical maximum bandwidth of HBM.
- To find a reliable way to benchmark the HBM performance in both Development Flows.
- To benchmark the performance of the HBM memory in both applications.
- To provide some guidelines on how to optimise a design which takes advantage of the HBM memory.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders, each representing one of the two design flows under investigation:

1. **HBM-Vitis**: This folder contains the code and related files developed using the Vitis Accel design flow.

2. **HBM-Vivado**: In this folder, you will find the code and associated files developed using the Vivado design flow.
